# 💧🌧 Thies to Zarr 🌧💧

## In this repository you’ll find 🔍:

* 📘 In the ```Thies_to_Zarr``` ```notebook```, you’ll find the code needed to convert the telegram output from a Thies disdrometer into structured ```.csv``` files. All you need to do is specify the input path and the output directory — the rest is automated ⚙️.

* 🧹 Additionally, the ```Thies_Filtered``` ```notebook``` includes data-cleaning techniques based on methods reported in the scientific literature. These help improve the reliability of your measurements and ensure consistency in further analyses 📊.

This repository is intended to facilitate the preprocessing of disdrometer data for research in precipitation microphysics, rainfall estimation, and related atmospheric studies 🌧️📈.

📄 <span style="color:green">Additionally</span>, you’ll find in this [link](https://www.thiesclima.com/db/dnl/5.4110.xx.x00_Laser_Precipitation_Monitor_eng.pdf) the Thies disdrometer manual, where you can explore the type of information provided by the instrument and better understand its data structure and measurement principles 🌡️📘.
